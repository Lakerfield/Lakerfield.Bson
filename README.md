# Lakerfield.Bson

A clone of the MongoDB.Bson package from https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver/tree/0d8134ec990cad5b2ad4d74a244f6ecf4666b498

The current implementation has a static ClassMap

This will be a copy with a new identity, so it is possible to use two seperate BsonClassMaps in an application
